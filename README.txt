Introduction

This Project describes the use of Spark for ETL and descriptive analysis. 
In this proposed concept, I make use of the patient data sets to compute a statistical summary of the data sample. 
Considering the large volume of data being generated in the healthcare industry, mostly in the form of Electronic Health Record (EHR), 
a big data approach is ideal for collecting and analyzing these data from different sources such as hospitals, laboratories and physician offices. 
This allows stakeholders to make guided and well informed decisions from the insights gained from applying big data methods to these datasets.




Data Decription

In healthcare, HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable. Privacy and security of patient data is very important and sensitive. 
Hence, improvision is essential to demonstrate this project.
The data illustrated contains the same characteristics that exist in the actual medical database such as patients’ admission details, demographics, socioeconomic details, labs, medications, etc.
